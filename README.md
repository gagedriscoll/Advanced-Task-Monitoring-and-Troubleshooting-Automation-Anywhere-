# Advanced-Task-Monitoring-and-Troubleshooting-Automation-Anywhere-
I created a system of tasks, in addition to building out an Access Database, capable of scheduling, monitoring, and troubleshooting the status of existing automated tasks in the Automation Anywhere environment. This has many implications including immediate notification to developer/ client, kick-off of subsequent task / termination of "hanging" task, and less required interaction with AA control room. Ultimately, the goals were realized of further advancing the status of corporate automated processes as well as countless employee-hours saved, perpetually fostering an increasing ROI.
